# BIDIFAC
Bidimensional matrix factorization

R code to perform factorization and dimension reduction of bidimensionally linked data matrices [1].  The file BIDIFAC.R gives functions to perform the BIDIFAC factorization, simulate data, and perform missing value imputation using BIDIFAC.  See BIDIFAC_example.R for example usage.

The functions bidifac.plus.R, bidifac.plus.impute.R, and bidifac.plus.given.R perform the BIDIFAC+ method, described in [2].
